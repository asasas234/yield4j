* Run finally blocks for "paused" generator in finalize method. Perhaps.
* Error if yield_return or yield_break used as non-statement.
* Make messages consistent and correct. Unreachable code vs statement? Upper/lower case on first letter?
* Move messages into a message bundle.
* yield foreach: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wesdyer/archive/2007/03/23/all-about-iterators.aspx
* Adjust source code positions of rewritten statements to make error reporting work properly. Also debugging.
* Add additional test cases to verify that the resulting exception from a try-with-resources is the correct one.
* Rename setState on the iterator class to yield_return, to make error message due to type mismatch easier to understand. Possibly also ditch index parameter?
* Remove yield4j as a runtime dependency. Should be compile-time dependency only.
